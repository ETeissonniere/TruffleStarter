# Truffle starter

A truffle box to help you get started with your solidity projects.

It features:
- abi and bytecode extracting scripts
- flattener
- `openzeppelin-solidity` and `openzeppelin-test-helpers` preinstalled
- gas reporting for tests
- test coverage generator
- javascript and solidity linters
- awesome `truffle-config.js` file

Get started with `npx truffle unbox ETeissonniere/TruffleStarter`.

You will need to define the `MNEMONIC` and `INFURA_API_KEY`, to do so you
can copy `.env.example` to `.env` (ignored by git) and edit it.
